                    Hello, I'm Giovan, an experienced audio engineer with a decade of active involvement in the industry. <br> 
                    Throughout my career, I've had the privilege to collaborate with numerous talented individuals and contribute to a diverse array of projects.<br>
                    <br> 
                    My work spans across various formats including reality and magazine TV shows, competition programs, and live television broadcasts. <br> 
                    <br> 
                    I've meticulously edited thousands of hours of voiceovers, skillfully recorded them, and delved into the intricate art of ADR, which I deeply respect. <br>
                    <br>I find immense fulfillment in my work and continuously strive to enhance my skills and capabilities as an audio engineer. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and I am committed to further refining my craft to deliver exceptional results.
